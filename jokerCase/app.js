//My inital aim is to create a function that takes in a string and converts each character that is a letter to alternate between lower and upper case, starting with lower case and returns the new string
// The function will ignore other characters, including special letter characters such as Ã©.


//The first step is creating the global variable letterTest which will hold a RegExp expression for all letters of the alphabet upper and lower case.

//Now the function jokerCase() will be created. It will take one argument, inString , a string
